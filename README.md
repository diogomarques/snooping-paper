# Data analysis for <TODO>
This repo contains the analysis files necessary to reproduce all tables, 
figures, and bits of quantitative analysis on:

<TODO>

It also contains reduced and scrambled datasets necessary for analysis, in 
folder datasets. To load all the data in a specific study, source() one of the
"sX_data.R" scripts.

A full dataset is not made publicly available for privacy reasons. Collating the 
available datasets will NOT reproduce the original dataset.

# Mapping between files and paper

### s3_varselection.R
Appendix D  and Table 8

### s4_models.R 
Appendix E2, Figure 2, and Section 7.2.2.

### s4_scale.R 
Appendix F, and Section 7.2.1.

# Work-in-progress

I'm in the process of cleaning up and moving old analysis code to this repo, to
make all analysis easily reproducible. If you see this paragraph, the process is 
not over.
