# Data analysis for <TODO>
This repo contains the analysis files necessary to reproduce all tables, 
figures, and bits of quantitative analysis on:

Diogo Marques, Ildar Muslukhov, Tiago Guerreiro, Konstantin Beznosov and Lu√≠s 
Carrico (2016). "Snooping on Mobile Phones: Prevalence and Trends". SOUPS 2016.  https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2016/technical-sessions/presentation/marques

It also contains reduced and scrambled datasets necessary for analysis, in 
folder datasets. To load all the data in a specific study, source() one of the
"sX_data.R" scripts.

Full datasets are not made publicly available for privacy reasons. Collating the available datasets will NOT reproduce the original datasets.

# Mapping between files and paper

### s3_varselection.R
Appendix D and Table 8

### s3_models.R
Apprendix E1, Figure 1

### s3_correlation.R
Section 6.7 

### s4_models.R 
Appendix E2, Figure 2, and Section 7.2.2.

### s4_scale.R 
Appendix F, and Section 7.2.1.

# Work-in-progress

I'm in the process of cleaning up and moving old analysis code to this repo, to
make all analysis easily reproducible. If you see this paragraph, the process is 
not over.
